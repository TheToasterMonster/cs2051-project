\maketitle

\section{Background}
% This section should develop the basic definitions and
% preliminary results required for the statement and proof of
% your main result, including examples that help the reader to
% develop intuition for the concepts presented. Start from scratch, remember your audience is other 2051 students.
\begin{itemize}
  \item Definition of $\pi(x)$, the number of primes $\le x$.
  \item Euclid's proof that $\lim_{x \to \infty}\pi(x) = \infty$
  \item Introduce the Riemann zeta function, $\zeta(s) = \sum_{n = 1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n^s}$
  \item Use the $\zeta(2)$ case and $\frac{\sin{x}}{x}$ Taylor series to show $\zeta(2) = \frac{\pi^2}{6}$
  \item Use above idea to derive Euler product formula
  \item Use Euler product formula with $\zeta(1)$ to get that $\sum_{p}\frac{1}{p} = \infty$, also showing the infinitude of primes
  \item Move on to some other main topic?
\end{itemize}


\section{Main result}
% In this section, you should state and prove your main result,
% and provide some basic consequences and examples that help the
% reader to understand it. You may want to change this section's
% name to something more informative.


\section{Extension/application/generalisation}
% You should change this section's name to something relevant to
% your project (e.g. "Applications of the RSA encryption
% algorithm" or "Linear Diophantine equations in $n$ unknowns"


\section{Preliminary Code and Illustrations}
% Here should be some illustration of the concepts described above. Also place any code you used to generate the code (use the lstlisting package if this applies to you).


\section{Reflection/Conclusion}
% You should change this section's name to something relevant to
% your project. This section allows you to reflect or conclude
% the work you have done in your project and discuss future work
% that could be done on the project (e.g. applications you tried
% to make but couldn't find the time).


\section{References}
% Here you should acknowledge people whose help you are thankful
% for (and why), and any sources such as books and websites that
% you used when studying for the project.
